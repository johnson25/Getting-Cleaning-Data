###Measurements:
*Time-domain signals
*Frequency-domain signals

###Transformations:
*The training and test datasets were merged into one dataset.
*The measurements on mean and standard deviation were selected for each measurement and others were omitted.
*The activity identifiers were replaced with decriptive activity names.
*The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names, expanded the names , removed the special characters (, -), intial f and t were expanded to frequency and time, several terms like acc, gyro etc were expanded.
*Final dataset was created with the mean of each varibale for each activity and each subject.
